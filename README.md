YardSale Online

Description

YardSale Online is a web application designed to help users sell unwanted household items and notify their neighbors about upcoming yard sales. With the increasing trend of online shopping, our platform allows users to list items for sale, giving neighbors the option to purchase online and have the products delivered to their doorsteps.

Motivation

To make yard sales more accessible and convenient for both sellers and buyers.

To help users declutter their homes efficiently while reaching a larger audience.

To provide a seamless and user-friendly experience for buying and selling second-hand items online.

Problem Solved

Traditional yard sales have limited reach and require physical presence.

Online marketplaces are often cluttered with unrelated listings, making it hard to find local deals.

This project streamlines the process by integrating local sales with online purchasing and delivery options.

What I Learned

Implementing an e-commerce-like experience for a local marketplace.

Developing a responsive web application with user authentication and item listing functionalities.

Handling online transactions and delivery logistics.
